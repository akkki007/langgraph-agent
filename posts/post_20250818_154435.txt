- **Typography:** Utilize a modern, sans-serif font similar to the one used in the reference images. Key phrases should be bolded or highlighted in green for emphasis.

**Additional Elements:**
- **Call to Action:** Include a subtle call to action at the bottom, such as "Swipe for more details" or "Follow us for updates," in a smaller font.
